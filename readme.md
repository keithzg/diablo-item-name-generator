DIABLO-STYLE ITEM NAME GENERATOR
================================

## Preamble

Hey! Keith here, "project" lead and such. Welcome to the readme!

## Install

To run names.py script, err, install python. It should be pretty lean on specific dependencies (hell, I'm only importing "random").

To run names.html, use a web browser?

To run arpg.html, you'll need Bootstrap, and you'll have to re-write the paths (I've hard-coded them for my own website at the moment; I may rethink that later).
