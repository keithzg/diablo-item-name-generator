DIABLO-STYLE ITEM NAME GENERATOR
================================

## Preamble

Hey! Keith here, "project" lead and such. Welcome to the readme!


## Licence / License

The code in this project is licensed under the GPLv3, with the "or later" clause. I might add Copyleft.next to that if possible, and maybe the AGPL makes sense, but we'll figure that out later. A copy of the General Public License is provided in the source repository.

## Install

To run names.py script, err, install python. It should be pretty lean on specific dependencies (hell, I'm only importing "random").

To run names.html, use a web browser?

To run arpg.html, you'll need Bootstrap, and you'll have to re-write the paths (I've hard-coded them for my own website at the moment; I may rethink that later).
